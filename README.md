In part 1, Irefactor existing Wheel of Fortune code to use inheritance in various ways, and I code classes  “GameInstance” and  “GamesRecord” that can be used with Wheel of Fortune and other games.
In part 2, I design and code Mastermind and refactor Wheel of Fortune so that the similarities between the games are codified in a superclass.
